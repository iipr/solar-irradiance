# Deep Learning for solar irradiance forecasting
In this repostitory we gather and expand results obtained with a Deep Learning
system for solar irradiance forecasting. It is organised as follows:


- **Datasets**: The data used in our experiments is subject to distribution restrictions:
    _These data and any subset may not be publically redistributed by any means._
    Thus, we provide a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/iipr/solar-irradiance/blob/master/etl-data.ipynb)
    to reproduce how we transformed it for our models.
    Details [here](https://github.com/iipr/solar-irradiance/blob/master/data.md).


- **Result tables**: Skill scored by each model for every horizon alongside model
    hyperparameters. Also, robustness tests for all convolutional LSTM models.
    Details [here](https://github.com/iipr/solar-irradiance/blob/master/tables.md).

- **Graphs**: Sensor distribution map, robustness tests, sample predictions,
    animated irradiance maps...
    Details [here](https://github.com/iipr/solar-irradiance/blob/master/graphs.md).
