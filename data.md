# Datasets

The datasets comprise almost 20 months of measurements, sampled every minute.
Three datasets can be obtained using the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/iipr/solar-irradiance/blob/master/etl-data.ipynb):

- Standardised Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI).
- Clear-Sky Index (CSI).
- Irradiance maps of standardised GHI. Map shapes of 8 × 8 and 10 × 10.
